# CSIII-Project2

This project was about using HashMaps to store data in the CityData file and determine whether a city was big or not depending on its population. 
I wanted to successfully sort and parse our data from the CityData file and store it in a “database”. I accomplished this by 
reading each line of data from the file and adding it to the HashMap. I then created methods that tested whether or not the population of 
the city was big based on the key value and printed it in our output file.

This project was able to determine whether a city was a small city or a big city based on its population. 
This was done using a set number that our group decided to be the benchmark in determining a city’s subjective size. 
This number could’ve been changed which would’ve caused results to vary. I chose 100,000 because it seemed like a relative average 
of most of the populations of the cities. This project successfully was able to take a file and put all its data into a HashMap object.
I was also able to output the data back out of the Hashmap and into an output file. I created new methods in new classes and also created
new methods in pre existing classes in order to fit the needs of this project.
